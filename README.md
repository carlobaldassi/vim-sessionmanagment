Automatisation layer for ViM session managment
----------------------------------------------

This plugin adds an automatisation layer for ViM session
managment:

* Session files are saved under a default directory
* Sessions are loaded by calling a bash script

It currently is in rudimentary stage, with no documentation
and no avaliable customisation options.

Please review the code before usage.
